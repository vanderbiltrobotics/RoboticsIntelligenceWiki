<!-- TITLE: Bandsaw -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A Bandsaw is a power saw with a long blade that can make either horizontal or vertical cuts. It can cut a variety of materials with different sizes. -->

# Types
## Vertical Bandsaw
A vertical bandsaw is a stationary blade that allows for the machinist to move their workpiece into the blade. This allows for complex shapes and angles to be cut out of the workpiece.

__How to Use__
1. Turn on the blade.
2. Slowly push the workpiece into the blade. Be mindful of fingers being in the path of the blade. 
-If necessary, use a piece of wood or other stock material to push the workpiece to avoid fingers being in the path of the blade.
3. Turn off the blade.
4. Clean off metal shaving and dust that may have been created during cut.

## Horizontal Bandsaw
A horizontal bandsaw holds the workpiece still while the blade swings down through the piece. It is often used to cut long materials such as pipes, bars, and L-bracket stock material.

__How to Use__
1. Raise the arm and turn the knob to lock the position.
2. Position the material and tighten the clamp to a snug fit.
3. Unlock and lower the arm to slightly above the material and check the alignment of the blade with the cut mark.
4. Tighten the clamp on the workpiece.
5. Start the blade.
6. Adjust the rate of the arm being lowered by turning the knob.
7. Once comfortable with the rate, let gravity control the arm dropping and allow the blade to cut through the piece
8. Once the cut has been finished, turn off the blade and remove part. Be careful- part may be hot after the cut.
