<!-- SUBTITLE: A Bandsaw is a power saw with a long blade that can make either horizontal or vertical cuts. It can cut a variety of materials with different sizes. -->

# Types
## Vertical Bandsaw
A vertical bandsaw is a stationary blade that allows for the machinist to move their workpiece into the blade. This allows for complex shapes and angles to be cut out of the workpiece.

__How to Use__
1. Turn on the blade
2. Slowly push the workpiece into the blade. Be mindful of fingers being in the path of the blade. If necessary, use a piece of wood or other stock material to push the workpiece to avoid fingers being in the path of the blade.
3. Turn off the blade

## Horizontal Bandsaw
A horizontal bandsaw holds the workpiece still while the blade swings down through the piece.
