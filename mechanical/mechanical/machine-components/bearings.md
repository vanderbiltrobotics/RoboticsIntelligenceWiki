<!-- TITLE: Bearings -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: How you support things that move -->

# Purpose
A bearing constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces friction between moving parts. In other words, a bearing only lets the part it incases move in the way you want (usually just a shaft rotating).
