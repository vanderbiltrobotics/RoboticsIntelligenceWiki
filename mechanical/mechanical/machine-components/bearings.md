<!-- TITLE: Bearings -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: How you support things that move -->

# Purpose
A bearing constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces friction between moving parts. In other words, a bearing only lets the part it incases move in the way you want (usually just a shaft rotating).

# Types
## Linear
Allows for rotation around and movement along the shaft/round beam.

## Ball or Roller
Has to be pressed up against a retaining ring, stepped shaft, or something similar. Resists radial and a small amount of axial load (not meant to). Also, many ball bearings can be used for linear, thrust, and tapered bearings, but are most commonly used for radial bearings, which is why we name it as such.

## Thrust
Also has to be pressed up against a retaing ring, steeped shaft, or something similar. Resists axial and a small amount of radial load (not meant to). Can be something as simple as a washer.

## Angular-Contact or Tapered
