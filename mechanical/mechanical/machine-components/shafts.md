# Purpose
Shafts are a fundamental machine component used to transmit motion from a motor to other systems. If your system requires rotary motion, you will probably be using a shaft. Shafts are usually used along with motors, shaft couplers, keys, and retaining rings. 

# Types
## Keyed Shaft
Keyed shafts are just normal shafts with a keyway. A keyway is a small rectangular groove that is cut out along the length of the shaft. A key then fits inside the keyway and is used to transmit force from the shaft to an external object, such as a gear. The external object will have a corresponding keyway slot so that the key fits within both keyways and couples the objects' motion.
