# Purpose
A bearing constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces friction between moving parts. In other words, a bearing only lets the part it incases move in the way you want (usually just a shaft rotating). In general,

# Types
## Linear
Allows for rotation around and movement along the shaft/round beam. 
![Linearbearing](/uploads/linearbearing.png "Linearbearing")
## Ball or Roller
Has to be pressed up against a retaining ring, stepped shaft, or something similar. Resists radial and a small amount of axial load (not meant to). Also, many ball bearings can be used for linear, thrust, and tapered bearings, but are most commonly used for radial bearings, which is why we name it as such.

## Thrust
Also has to be pressed up against a retaing ring, steeped shaft, or something similar. Resists axial and a small amount of radial load (not meant to). Can be something as simple as a washer.

## Angular-Contact or Tapered
Pushes the ball bearings against an angled side inside the bearing - allowing it to resist both axial and radial load well.

# When to Use (what you're probably here for)
The short answer is that you use a bearing when you want to constrain/support a moving part without creating much friction. 


# How to House a Bearing
If you can, try to buy a flanged bearing, which you simply need to bolt to a plate to attach. However, these are often heavy and too big to fit in the intended application.

Otherwise, you have to make your own bearing housing, which requires the careful milling of a hole, slightly undersized so there's a press fit (it "squishes" in). There's a lot of science and testing done by engineers before us, but for our applications, 1~2 thou per inch diameter is very typical. More about press fits and milling using a boring bar can be found ___.

# TODO
* Add information about non roller-element bearings (bushings and such)
