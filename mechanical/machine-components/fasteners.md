<!-- TITLE: Fasteners -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Fasteners -->

# Overview
Fasteners are a very broad group of mechanical devices that joins or fixes two objects together. All of you have definitely used some sort of fastener like a screw, bolt, nail, but often times there are better options. The intent of this article is to give a survey of common fasteners used, as well as how to understand the sizing of them. Feel free to add any other type of fastener to this article.

# Types
## Bolts

### Bolt Sizing
## Nails and Screws
Neither of these are used on the robot, so this is more of an explanation of why these two commonly used fasteners are bad for our application. Nails are bad because they are much better suited for woodworking. Screws are bad because they require that the hole be threaded to work, making bolts just better to use.
## Rivets

Rivets are a permanent fastener, that have the upside of being easy to install, compact, and light (although they can also be removed with the use of a drill). The most common type of rivet is a blind rivet, which work by forcing a metal cylinder through another hollow one, deforming the rivet to secure the two parts together. For choosing the rivet, make sure to pick the correct length as you need at least 1/8" more than the thickness of the materials being bound. The shear and tensile strength specs are usually given, so use that to determine the material and diameter to use.

## Retaining Rings

Retaining rings are used to fasten or transfer load from components onto a shaft. They are expandable rings that you "snap" into a groove, where the portion outside of the groove prevents any part on the shaft from moving past it. Thus, they are frequently used to secure a gear or wheel on a shaft where an entire coupler is not necessary. For choosing a retaining ring type or material, I suggest https://www.machinedesign.com/archive/using-retaining-rings-properly.
## Clevis Pins

Clevis pins are often used to fasten parts that need to be quickly disassembled, where bolts and rivets are undesirable. It is simply a rod with a hole on the end to insert a split pin, securing the rod. Since the pin doesn't actually place any pressure between the two parts, clevis pins are not good at securing rotation or vibration.
