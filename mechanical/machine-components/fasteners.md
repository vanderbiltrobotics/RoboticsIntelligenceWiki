# Overview
Fasteners are a very broad group of mechanical devices that joins or fixes two objects together. All of you have definitely used some sort of fastener like a screw, bolt, nail, but often times there are better options.

Clevis pins are often used to fasten parts that need to be quickly disassembled, making bolts or rivets undesirable. It is simply a rod with a hole on the end to insert a split pin, securing the rod. Since the pin doesn't actually place any pressure between the two parts, clevis pins are not good at securing rotation or vibration.
