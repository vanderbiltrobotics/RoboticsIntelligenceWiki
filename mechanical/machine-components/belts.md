# Overview
Belts are one of the standard ways we move objects or power from point A to B. In the context of the robot, it means that they are very often used to deposit the gravel into the collection bin, dig using a bucket elevator, or as a part of a powertrain. As such, it's important to choose the correct belt for the application, which heavily depends on the length required, the power transmitted, and the stability needed.

This article will mainly cover the different types of belts and common issues the team has had. For calculating the amount of power a belt will transmit https://www.tec-science.com/mechanical-power-transmission/belt-drive/power-transmission-of-a-belt-drive/ .
