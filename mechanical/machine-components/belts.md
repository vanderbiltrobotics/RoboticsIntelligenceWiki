<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Belts -->

# Overview
Belts are one of the standard ways we move objects or power from point A to B. In the context of the robot, it means that they are very often used to deposit the gravel into the collection bin, dig using a bucket elevator, or as a part of a powertrain. As such, it's important to choose the correct belt for the application, which heavily depends on the length required, the power transmitted, and the stability needed.

This article will mainly cover the different types of belts and common issues the team has had.

# Types
### Flat
Flat belts are... flat. They are not as commonly used anymore due to the other types having greater upside, but they can still be used for power transmission. These belts can go off center easily, but a crowned pulley or edge guards can fix this. They have the greatest variety in lengths, widths, and sizes due to their simplicity, and can also be used for transferring material easiest.
### V-Belt
V belts have a trapezoidal cross section to fit within a groove in the pulley. It is one of the best types of belts for power transmission as they practically cannot go off center due to the V-shape
### Chain and Sprocket
### Timing
Also called a serpentine belt, these belts have ridges going across the belt
### Ribbed
Also called a multi or poly v-belt,
