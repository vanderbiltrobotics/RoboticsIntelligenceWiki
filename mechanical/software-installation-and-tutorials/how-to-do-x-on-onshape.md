<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of How To Do X On Onshape -->

# Overview
As of 9/9/19, no one on the team has used Onshape for more than a couple weeks, meaning that our experienced members will not be able to answer as many questions as we would like. That said, Onshape is a simpler CAD software than Autodesk, and there are 3 specific resources I would like to highlight. As a sidenote, the ability to figure out how to answer your own question is important for almost every facet of your engineering career, not just Onshape.

## Tutorials

One tutorial I particularly recommend is the one on document history and versions, to learn how Onshape's version control works.
## Forum
If you have a more specific question or just don't want to go through the entire tutorial, search on the Onshape forums. It's almost guaranteed that someone has had the same question/issue as you.
