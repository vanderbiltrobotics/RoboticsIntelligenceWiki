# What is Onshape?
Onshape is a web browser CAD software that we will start using for the 2020 year. It does not have as many detailed functions, but it covers the scope of this project while also being easy to use, download, and share files with others.
# The Steps
1) Go to Onshape.com, and click "Request Trial" on the top right.
2) Fill in the information requested, making sure that you say that you are a student of Vanderbilt, thus giving you the educational license.
3) You're done... you can now start messing around with Onshape, and you should ask a member of exec to add your account to the team!
