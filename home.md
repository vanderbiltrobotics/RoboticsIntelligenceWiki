<!-- TITLE: Vanderbilt Robotics Intelligence Wiki  -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Robotics Intelligence Wiki is a compilation of the combined knowledge and resources of Vanderbilt Robotics. The topics include all aspects of robotic design from mechanical part selection to advanced autonomy and machine learning algorithms. This site was designed to give members of the Vanderbilt Robotics club (and hopefully the greater robotics community) a centralized location containing resources that will be valuable in the design process. The objective of this project is to accumulate knowledge over time in an easy to access format.  -->

# Organization
This wiki is divided into three main sections:
* [Mechanical](./mechanical)
* [Electrical](./electrical)
* [Programming](./programming)

Each of these subpages contain subpages and articles describing specific topics in detail. The landing page for each of these pages will list all of the subsections and articles under that topic.
