<!-- TITLE: Vanderbilt Robotics Intelligence Wiki  -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Robotics Intelligence Wiki is a compilation of the combined knowledge and resources of Vanderbilt Robotics. The topics include all aspects of robotic design from mechanical part selection to advanced autonomy and machine learning algorithms. -->
This site was designed to give members of the Vanderbilt Robotics club (and hopefully the greater robotics community) a centralized location containing resources that will be valuable in the design process. The objective of this project is to accumulate knowledge over time in an easy to access format.
