<!-- TITLE: Vanderbilt Robotics Intelligence Wiki  -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: The Robotics Intelligence Wiki is a compilation of the combined knowledge and resources of Vanderbilt Robotics. The topics include all aspects of robotic design from mechanical part selection to advanced autonomy and machine learning algorithms. This site was designed to give members of the Vanderbilt Robotics club (and hopefully the greater robotics community) a centralized location containing resources that will be valuable in the design process. The objective of this project is to accumulate knowledge over time in an easy to access format.  -->

# Organization
This wiki is divided into three main sections:
* [Mechanical](./mechanical)
* [Electrical](./electrical)
* [Programming](./programming)

Each of these subpages contain subpages and articles describing specific topics in detail. The landing page for each of these pages will list all of the subsections and articles under that topic.

# Navigation
There are a few ways you can find the articles you are searching for.
* Click on the links above to find the articles and subsections related to that specific topic. Jump through these landing pages until you find the article.
* Click on the `All Pages` button on the navigation bar on the left. This will list the hierarchy of subsections and pages in the navigation bar, which you can follow to find the article.
* Use the search bar at the top to search for keywords in the article.

# How to write an article
You've found a topic you need to document. That's great! You just need to follow a few simple steps and you'll be writing your article in no time! 

Before you start this process, make sure you are logged in. Follow the instructions in [Creating an Account](#creating-an-account) if you've never logged in before.

Let's say you were writing an article about selecting roller element bearings.
1. Navigate to the correct subsection in which your article belongs. For the example, it would be Mechanical --> Part Selection. 
2. Once you are on the landing page for the section, click on `Create` in the top right corner. The path for subsections should already be filled in for you. Just add the title of the article at the end of the path. For the example, the path would be `mechanical/part-selection/roller-element-bearing-selection`. 
3. Click `Create`. A new window should appear allowing you to edit the page. Make sure the title is correct and provide a brief description of the article in the subsection. 
4. Write the article using Markdown syntax. If you've never used Markdown before, here's a [quick cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). (You can come back and edit the article later)
5. To maintain the organization of the website, you need to **add a link to the article in the subsection page**. For the example, you would go to `https://wiki.vur.ddns.net/mechanical/part-selection` and click edit. Add the link using the Markdown syntax in the `Table of Contents` section. 

# Creating an Account
We have configured the wiki to use your Slack account (associated with the `vanderbiltrobotics` workspace to login). 

Click on the `login` button on the left navigation bar and click `login using Slack`. **If it gives you an error, message Swapnil on Slack to give you permissions to edit the website.**
