# What is the Robotics Intelligence Database
The Robotics Intelligence Database is a compilation of the combined knowledge and resources of Vanderbilt Robotics. The topics include all aspects of robotic design from mechanical part selection to advanced autonomy and machine learning algorithms.

This site was designed to give members of the Vanderbilt Robotics club (and hopefully the greater robotics community) a centralized location containing resources that will be valuable in the design process. The objective of this project is to accumulate knowledge over time in an easy to access format.
